# üóÑÔ∏è **Setting up SQLModel**

To integrate a SQL database into our planner application, the first step is to install the **SQLModel** library. SQLModel is a modern library, built by the creator of FastAPI, that is designed to combine the best of **Pydantic** and **SQLAlchemy**.

## üì¶ Installing the SQLModel Library

You can install the library using `pip`:

```bash
pip install sqlmodel
```

Before we dive into adding a database to our planner application, let's explore some of the key methods and concepts from SQLModel that we will use in this section.

## üìú Tables: Defining Your Data Structure

A **table** is essentially an object that contains all the data for a specific entity, such as our events. The table consists of **columns** (the data attributes, like `title` or `location`) and **rows** (the individual records).

To create a table using SQLModel, you first define a model class. This class inherits from the `SQLModel` base class and includes a special `table` configuration variable set to `True`.

The variables defined in the class will represent the table's columns by default. Let's look at how our `Event` table will be defined:

```python
from typing import Optional, List
from sqlmodel import SQLModel, Field
from sqlalchemy import Column, JSON  # <-- Import Column and JSON

class Event(SQLModel, table=True):
    id: Optional[int] = Field(default=None, primary_key=True)
    title: str
    image: str
    description: str
    location: str
    tags: List[str] = Field(default=[], sa_column=Column(JSON))
```

### Code Explanation üßê

  * **`from sqlalchemy import Column, JSON`**: We import `Column` and `JSON` directly from SQLAlchemy. This is necessary because some standard Python types, like `List`, don't have a direct equivalent in all SQL databases.
  * **`class Event(SQLModel, table=True):`**: This line defines our table.
      * It inherits from `SQLModel`, giving it all the Pydantic data validation features and the SQLAlchemy database mapping features.
      * `table=True` explicitly tells SQLModel that this model represents a database table (and not just a data validation model).
  * **`id: Optional[int] = Field(...)`**: This defines our `id` column.
      * `Optional[int]`: The type is an integer, but it's optional because when we create a new event, we won't provide an ID.
      * `Field(default=None, ...)`: We use `Field` to provide extra configuration. `default=None` means the database will be responsible for generating this value.
      * `primary_key=True`: This designates the `id` column as the primary key for this table.
  * **`title: str`, `image: str`, etc.**: These standard class variables are automatically converted by SQLModel into table columns with the appropriate data type (like `VARCHAR`).
  * **`tags: List[str] = Field(...)`**: This is a special column.
      * `sa_column=Column(JSON)`: This is how we handle complex types. `sa_column` stands for "SQLAlchemy Column." Since most SQL databases don't have a native "list of strings" type, we are telling SQLModel to use the `JSON` data type to store our Python list. This is a common and effective solution.

### ‚ùì What Is a Primary Key?

A **primary key** is a unique identifier for a single record (or row) in a database table. It ensures that every record can be precisely located and that no two records are identical. The `id` is the most common primary key.

## ‚û°Ô∏è Rows: Inserting Data

Data sent to a database table is stored in **rows** under the specified columns. To insert data into the rows, you first create an instance of your table model (just like a Pydantic model) and fill in the variables.

For example, to create a new event, we would first create an instance of the `Event` model:

```python
new_event = Event(title="Book Launch",
                  image="src/fastapi.png",
                  description="The book launch event will be held at Packt HQ, Packt city",
                  location="Google Meet",
                  tags=["packt", "book"])
```

Next, to save this object to the database, you create a database transaction using a `Session`:

```python
with Session(engine) as session:
    session.add(new_event)
    session.commit()
```

The operation above might seem new. Let‚Äôs look at what the `Session` class is and what it does.

## üí¨ Sessions: The Database Intermediary

A **session** object handles all the interaction between your Python code and the database. It acts as an intermediary for executing operations. The `Session` class takes an instance of a SQL `engine` as its argument (we'll see the `engine` next).

Here are some of the key `session` methods we will be using:

  * **`add(object)`**: This method is responsible for adding a database object (like our `new_event`) to the session's *memory*. The object is now "staged" and is waiting to be committed.
  * **`commit()`**: This method is responsible for "flushing" or saving all staged transactions (like the ones we `add`ed) from the session's memory into the actual database. This makes the changes permanent.
  * **`get(model, id)`**: This method retrieves a *single row* from the database. It takes two parameters: the model class (e.g., `Event`) and the primary key (ID) of the record you want to find.

## üèÅ Creating a Database

Now that we know how to create tables, rows, and sessions, let's look at how the database itself is created.

In SQLModel, connecting to a database is done via a **SQLAlchemy engine**. This engine is created by the `create_engine()` method, which you import from the `sqlmodel` library.

The `create_engine()` method takes the **database URL** as its main argument.

  * The format for a simple SQLite database file is `sqlite:///database.db`.
  * It also takes an optional argument, `echo`. When `echo=True`, it prints all the raw SQL commands it's executing to your console, which is extremely useful for debugging.

However, the `create_engine()` method *alone* isn‚Äôt sufficient to create the database file. To create the database *and* all the tables defined in your models, you must also call the `SQLModel.metadata.create_all(engine)` method.

Here is how it all comes together:

```python
from sqlmodel import SQLModel, create_engine

database_file = "database.db"
# Create the engine, telling it to connect to our local SQLite file
engine = create_engine(f"sqlite:///{database_file}", echo=True)

# This is the line that creates the database and tables
SQLModel.metadata.create_all(engine)
```

### Code Explanation üßê

  * **`SQLModel.metadata.create_all(engine)`**: This powerful method looks at all the classes that inherited from `SQLModel` and had `table=True` (like our `Event` class). It then:
    1.  Creates the `database.db` file if it doesn't already exist.
    2.  Generates and executes the `CREATE TABLE` SQL commands for all found models.

**A crucial note:** The file containing your table definitions (like `models/events.py`) **must be imported** into the file where this database connection code runs *before* you call `create_all()`. If the models aren't imported, SQLModel won't know about them, and no tables will be created.

# üóÑÔ∏è Integrating SQLModel for Database Operations

In our planner application, we will now perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for our events. To do this, we must integrate a database. We will start by creating the file that will manage our database connection.

```bash
touch database/connection.py
```

Now that we have created the database connection file, let‚Äôs create the functions and models required to connect our application to the database.

-----

## 1\. Updating the Event Model (`models/events.py`) ‚úèÔ∏è

We‚Äôll begin by modifying our original `Event` model class to transform it into a **SQLModel table class**. This class will now define both the API data shape (like Pydantic) and the database table structure (like SQLAlchemy).

```python
from typing import List, Optional
from sqlmodel import JSON, SQLModel, Field, Column

class Event(SQLModel, table=True):
    id: Optional[int] = Field(default=None, primary_key=True) 
    title: str
    image: str
    description: str
    tags: List[str] = Field(sa_column=Column(JSON))
    location: str

    model_config = {
        "arbitrary_types_allowed": True,
        "json_schema_extra": {
            "example": {
                "title": "FastAPI Book Launch",
                "image": "https://linktomyimage.com/image.png",
                "description": "We will be discussing the contents of the FastAPI book in this event.Ensure to come with your own copy to win gifts!",
                "tags": ["python", "fastapi", "book", "launch"],
                "location": "Google Meet"
            }
        }
    }
```

### Code Explanation üßê

  * **`from sqlmodel import JSON, SQLModel, Field, Column`**: We import the necessary components from SQLModel. `Column` and `JSON` are imported to handle data types that are not standard in SQL.
  * **`class Event(SQLModel, table=True):`**: This is the key change. By inheriting from `SQLModel` and setting `table=True`, we are instructing SQLModel that this class defines a database table.
  * **`id: Optional[int] = Field(default=None, primary_key=True)`**: We use `Field` to provide extra database configuration.
      * `Optional[int]`: The ID is optional because when we create a *new* event, we won't know the ID; the database will assign it.
      * `default=None`: Tells the database it should be responsible for generating the ID.
      * `primary_key=True`: This designates the `id` column as the unique identifier for this table.
  * **`tags: List[str] = Field(sa_column=Column(JSON))`**: Because most SQL databases do not have a native "list of strings" type, we must provide a special configuration.
      * `sa_column=Column(JSON)`: This tells SQLModel to use the `JSON` data type in the database to store our Python `List`.
  * **`model_config = { ... }`**: This replaces the old nested `class Config`. It's the Pydantic v2 method for setting model configurations.
      * `"arbitrary_types_allowed": True`: This allows for more complex types, often needed for compatibility with SQLAlchemy.
      * `"json_schema_extra": { ... }`: This provides the example data that will be displayed in the API documentation.

-----

## 2\. Creating the EventUpdate Model (`models/events.py`) ü©π

Next, we‚Äôll add another SQLModel class. This model will **not** be a table. Instead, it will be used to validate the data body for our `UPDATE` operations.

```python
class EventUpdate(SQLModel):
    title: Optional[str] = None
    image: Optional[str] = None
    description: Optional[str] = None
    tags: Optional[List[str]] = None
    location: Optional[str] = None
    
    model_config = {
        "json_schema_extra": {
            "example": {
                "title": "FastAPI Book Launch",
                "image": "https://linktomyimage.com/image.png",
                "description": "We will be discussing the contents of the FastAPI book in this event. Ensure to come with your own copy to win gifts!",
                "tags": ["python", "fastapi", "book", "launch"],
                "location": "Google Meet"
            }
        }
    }
```

### Code Explanation üßê

  * **`class EventUpdate(SQLModel):`**: Notice this model **does not** include `table=True`. It is only used for data validation, not to define a database table.
  * **`title: Optional[str] = None`**: Every field in this model is `Optional`. This is crucial for `UPDATE` (or `PATCH`) operations, as it allows a user to send a request containing *only* the fields they wish to change, without having to provide all the other fields.

-----

## 3\. Defining the Database Connection (`database/connection.py`) üîó

Now, let's define the configuration needed to create our database file and establish a connection.

```python
from sqlmodel import SQLModel, Session, create_engine
from models.events import Event

database_file = "planner.db"
database_connection_string = f"sqlite:///{database_file}"

connect_args = {"check_same_thread": False}
engine_url = create_engine(database_connection_string,
                           echo=True, connect_args=connect_args)

def conn():
    SQLModel.metadata.create_all(engine_url)

def get_session():
    with Session(engine_url) as session:
        yield session
```

### Code Explanation üßê

  * **`from models.events import Event`**: This import is **absolutely essential**. The `conn()` function will only create tables for models that have been imported and read by Python when it's called.
  * **`database_file = "planner.db"`**: This defines the name of our local database file. SQLite is a file-based database.
  * **`database_connection_string = ...`**: This is the standard format for a SQLite connection string.
  * **`connect_args = {"check_same_thread": False}`**: This argument is **required** for using SQLite with FastAPI. By default, SQLite only allows one thread to access it. FastAPI is asynchronous and may use multiple threads. This setting disables that check.
  * **`engine_url = create_engine(...)`**: This creates the main **engine**, which is the core interface to the database.
      * `echo=True`: This is a powerful debugging tool. It will print every raw SQL command that is executed to your console.
      * `connect_args=connect_args`: We pass in our `check_same_thread` setting.
  * **`def conn():`**: We define a simple function that will create our database and tables.
      * `SQLModel.metadata.create_all(engine_url)`: This powerful method searches for all classes that inherited from `SQLModel` and had `table=True` (like our `Event` class) and then generates and executes the `CREATE TABLE` SQL commands.
  * **`def get_session():`**: This is a **dependency generator**. It creates a database session for a single request.
      * `with Session(engine_url) as session:`: This ensures the database connection is properly opened.
      * `yield session`: The `yield` keyword provides this session to the API route that depends on it.
      * After the route is finished, the `with` statement automatically closes the session, preventing database connection leaks.

-----

## 4\. Managing the Application Lifecycle (`main.py`) üöÄ

Finally, we need to instruct our application to call the `conn()` function when it starts up. We will use FastAPI's modern `lifespan` event handler for this.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi.responses import RedirectResponse
from database.connection import conn
from routes.users import user_router
from routes.events import event_router
import uvicorn

from contextlib import asynccontextmanager

@asynccontextmanager
async def lifespan(app: FastAPI):
    print("Application startup... Database table creating...")
    conn()  # This calls our function to create tables
    yield
    print("Application shutdown...")

app = FastAPI(lifespan=lifespan)

app.include_router(user_router,  prefix="/user")
app.include_router(event_router, prefix="/event")

@app.get("/")
async def home():
    return RedirectResponse(url="/event/")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    uvicorn.run("main:app", host="0.0.0.0", port=8080, reload=True)
```

### Code Explanation üßê

  * **`from contextlib import asynccontextmanager`**: We import this to create our `lifespan` context manager.
  * **`@asynccontextmanager async def lifespan(app: FastAPI):`**: This special function defines what FastAPI should do during its startup and shutdown phases.
  * **`print(...)` and `conn()`**: All code *before* the `yield` keyword is executed **once, during application startup**. Here, we print a message and call our `conn()` function to ensure our tables are created.
  * **`yield`**: This keyword separates the startup logic from the shutdown logic.
  * **`print("Application shutdown...")`**: All code *after* the `yield` keyword is executed **once, during application shutdown**.
  * **`app = FastAPI(lifespan=lifespan)`**: We register our `lifespan` function with the main `FastAPI` instance.
  * **`@app.get("/") async def home(): ...`**: This adds a new convenience route. If a user visits the root of our API (`/`), they will be automatically redirected to the `/event/` endpoint.

-----

## 5\. Reviewing the Console Output üìä

When we run `python main.py`, the `lifespan` event and the `echo=True` engine provide detailed console output.

```console
python main.py
INFO:     Will watch for changes in these directories: ['C:\\Users\\Hashim\\Desktop\\resources\\fastapi-api\\06-database-integration']
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8080 (Press CTRL+C to quit)

INFO:     Application shutdown complete.
INFO:     Finished server process [10328]
INFO:     Stopping reloader process [14900]
```

### Output Explanation üßê

  * **`Application startup...`**: This is our custom print message from the `lifespan` function, confirming it ran.
  * **`INFO sqlalchemy.engine.Engine ...`**: This block is the output from `echo=True`. It shows SQLModel checking if the `event` table already exists.
  * **`CREATE TABLE event (...)`**: This is the most important part. SQLModel detected the table did not exist and generated and executed the precise SQL command to create our `event` table, perfectly matching our `Event` model.
  * **`INFO sqlalchemy.engine.Engine COMMIT`**: The transaction is committed, and the table is saved in the `planner.db` file.
  * **`Application startup complete.`**: The server is now running and ready to accept requests.
  * **`Application shutdown...`**: These lines appear when you stop the server (e.g., with `CTRL+C`), showing the shutdown part of the `lifespan` function executing correctly.
