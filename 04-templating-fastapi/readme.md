# 🎨 **Jinja The Python Templating Engine**

**Jinja** is a modern and powerful templating engine written in Python. Its primary purpose is to facilitate the rendering process of responses, allowing developers to dynamically generate content like HTML, XML, or other text-based formats.

In any templating language, there are two fundamental concepts:

  * **Variables**: These are placeholders that get replaced with actual values when the template is rendered.
  * **Tags**: These control the logic of the template, such as loops and conditional statements.

Jinja uses curly bracket syntax `{}` to distinguish its expressions from the static text or HTML in a template file.

## 🧱 Core Syntax Blocks

Jinja employs three primary syntax blocks to handle different tasks within a template.

  * `{% ... %}` - **Statements**: This syntax is used for control structures like `if` statements and `for` loops.
  * `{{ ... }}` - **Expressions**: This block is used to print the output of an expression or the value of a variable directly into the template. For example, `{{ todo.item }}` would display the value of the `item` attribute from the `todo` object.
  * `{# ... #}` - **Comments**: This syntax is used for writing comments. Anything inside these blocks will not be included in the final rendered output. For example: `{# This is a great API book! #}`.

You can pass various Python data types as variables to a Jinja template—including models, lists, or dictionaries—as long as they can be converted into strings for display.

Next, we will explore some of the most common and powerful features used in Jinja.

## ✨ Key Features of Jinja

### 💧 Filters: Modifying Your Data

While Jinja's syntax is similar to Python's, you cannot use standard Python syntax for data manipulation directly within a template (e.g., calling string methods). To perform modifications like joining strings or capitalizing text, Jinja provides **filters**.

A filter is applied to a variable using a pipe symbol (`|`). Some filters may also accept optional arguments in parentheses.

**Syntax with arguments:**

```jinja
{{ variable | filter_name(*args) }}
```

**Syntax without arguments:**

```jinja
{{ variable | filter_name }}
```

Let's look at some common built-in filters.

#### The `default` Filter

This filter provides a fallback value to display if the variable is undefined or `None`.

**Code:**

```jinja
{{ todo.item | default('This is a default todo item') }}
```

**Output:**

```
This is a default todo item
```

#### The `escape` Filter

This filter escapes a string for safe inclusion in HTML, which helps prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks by converting special characters like `<` and `>` into their HTML entity equivalents.

**Code:**

```jinja
{{ "<p>Hello</p>" | escape }}
```

**Output:**

```html
&lt;p&gt;Hello&lt;/p&gt;
```

#### Conversion Filters (`int` and `float`)

These filters are used to convert a value to an integer or a floating-point number.

**Code:**

```jinja
{{ 3.142 | int }}
{{ 31 | float }}
```

**Output:**

```
3
31.0
```

#### The `join` Filter

This filter joins the elements of a list into a single string, using an optional separator.

**Code:**

```jinja
{{ ['Packt', 'produces', 'great', 'books!'] | join(' ') }}
```

**Output:**

```
Packt produces great books!
```

#### The `length` Filter

This filter returns the number of items in an object, similar to Python's built-in `len()` function.

**Code:**

```jinja
Todo count: {{ todos | length }}
```

**Output (assuming `todos` has 4 items):**

```
Todo count: 4
```

### 🧠 Control Structures: Adding Logic to Templates

#### `if` Statements

The usage of `if` statements in Jinja is very similar to Python and allows for conditional rendering of content. These statements are written inside `{% ... %}` control blocks.

**Example:**

```jinja
{% if todos | length < 5 %}
  You don't have many items on your todo list!
{% else %}
  You have a busy day it seems!
{% endif %}
```

#### Loops

You can iterate over sequences like lists or dictionaries using a `for` loop, just as you would in Python.

**Example:**

```jinja
{% for todo in todos %}
  {{ todo.item }} 
{% endfor %}
```

Inside a `for` loop, Jinja provides access to special variables that give information about the state of the loop.

| Variable | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `loop.index` | The current iteration of the loop (1-indexed). |
| `loop.index0` | The current iteration of the loop (0-indexed). |
| `loop.revindex` | The number of iterations from the end of the loop (1-indexed). |
| `loop.revindex0` | The number of iterations from the end of the loop (0-indexed). |
| `loop.first` | `True` if this is the first iteration. |
| `loop.last` | `True` if this is the last iteration. |
| `loop.length` | The total number of items in the sequence. |
| `loop.cycle` | A helper function to cycle through a list of strings. |
| `loop.depth` | The current depth in a recursive loop (starts at 1). |
| `loop.depth0` | The current depth in a recursive loop (starts at 0). |
| `loop.previtem` | The item from the previous iteration (undefined on the first iteration). |
| `loop.nextitem` | The item from the next iteration (undefined on the last iteration). |
| `loop.changed(*val)`| `True` if its arguments have changed from the last iteration. |

### 🧩 Macros: Reusable Template Functions

A **macro** in Jinja is comparable to a function in a programming language. It allows you to define reusable pieces of template code to avoid repetition. A macro's main purpose is to render a reusable chunk of HTML.

For instance, you can define a macro to generate HTML `<input>` tags consistently across a form.

**Defining the Macro:**

```jinja
{% macro input(name, value='', type='text', size=20) %}
  <input type="{{ type }}" name="{{ name }}" value="{{ value }}" size="{{ size }}">
{% endmacro %}
```

**Calling the Macro:**
Now, you can easily create an input field by calling the macro.

```jinja
{{ input('item') }}
```

**Resulting HTML:**

```html
<input type="text" name="item" value="" size="20">
```

### 🏛️ Template Inheritance: The DRY Principle in Action

Perhaps the most powerful feature of Jinja is **template inheritance**. This feature is a direct application of the "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle and is incredibly useful in large web applications.

Template inheritance allows you to create a base template (or "skeleton") that contains the common elements of your site. Child templates can then **inherit** from this base template and **override** specific sections, or blocks, with their own content.
